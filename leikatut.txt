A functor $L:J' \rightarrow J $ is cofinal if for every element $k \in J$ there exists $j' \in J'$ and morphism $Lj' \rightarrow k$.

Let $C$ be a category which is indexed by a category $J$ and let $F$ be the indexing functor. Let $f:X \rightarrow Y$ be an arbitrary morphism in the category $J$ and let $D$ be an object of the category $C$ which forms a cone together with a family of morphisms $\{\phi_X\}_{X \in \ob(C)}$ and morphism $f$. We say that $(D, \phi)$ is a limit of $C$ if the following property holds: If $N$ together with family $\{\omega_X\}_{X \in \ob(C)} $ and morphism $f$ is any other cone of category $C$, then there exists a unique morphism $u:N \rightarrow D$ in such way that the following diagram commutes:
\end{maar} 

In this section we will interpret category as a model of first order logic

The colimit of a category $C$ is the dual statement of limit of $C$. We define the cocone to be dual of cone. Let $J$ be index category of $C$ then we say that a cocone induced by $D$ is the colimit of category $C$ if for every other cocone induced by $N$ there exists a unique morphism $u:D \rightarrow N$ in such a way that the diagram below commutes:

\begin{maar}
Let $\lambda$ be a quasi-ordered set and $\mathcal{L}$ a category. A direct $\lambda$-system consist of functor $D$ which assigns unique object $D(\lambda) \in \mathcal{L}$ and a family of morphism in such way that for every pair $a \leq b$ there exists unique morphism $D^b_a: D(a) \rightarrow D(b)$. The family of morphisms satisfies following conditions:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*),ref=(\arabic*)]
	
	\item For every triple $a \leq b \leq c$ in $\lambda$ functions commute in a following way: $D^c_b \circ D^b_a = D^c_a$
	\item For every $a \in \lambda$: $D^a_a = id_a$
	
\end{enumerate}

\end{maar}

The structure in above definition can be also viewed as category $C$ in such way that $\ob(C) = D(\lambda)$ and for every $D(a),D(b) \in \ob(C)$ there exists exactly one morphism in $\hom(D(a),D(b)$. In other words $\lambda$ is indexation of subcategory of $\mathcal{L}$.

Next we introduce a bit more complex category 

\begin{maar}
Direct systems together with natural transformations between them form Category. We will denote elements of this category shortly $(\lambda, \mathcal{L})$
\end{maar}
Taking dual and using functor $I$ instead of $D$ we see that natural transformation with inverse system form category. We will denote this category by $(\lambda, \mathcal{L}^{op})$. Now we can define limit of the category $(\lambda, \mathcal{L})$. We see that for every quasi-order $\lambda$ and object $k$ in $\mathcal{L}^{op}$ we can define inverse system by mapping every element $\lambda$ to the object $k$ and every functor between objects in $\lambda$ to identity functor. This forms inverse system which we will denote by $K$. Now natural transformations $\phi_a : D(a) \rightarrow K$ between $K$ and arbitrary element in $(\lambda, \mathcal{L})$ induces following: co(cone) 
$$
\begin{tikzpicture}

\node (w) at (2,0) {\(K\)};

\node (x2) at (0.7,-0.7) {\(\phi_a\)};

\node (x) at (0,-2) {\(D(a)\)};

\node (y2) at (3.3,-0.7) {\(\phi_b\)};

\node (y) at (4,-2) {\(D(b)\)};

\node (f) at (2,-2.4){\(D^b_a\)};


\draw[->] (y) -- (w);
\draw[->] (x) -- (w);
\draw[->] (x) -- (y);


\end{tikzpicture}
$$
So we can define (co)limit of this structure in unique way if it exists.

\begin{maar}
Let $X$ be set of vertices. Then abstract simplicial complex consist of collection $\{S_i\}_{i \in I}$ of finite dimensional simplexes which have edges in set $X$. The collection has property which is for every simplex face of it belongs to the collection. For every point in abstract simplicial complex $\mathcal{S}(X)$ we define coordinates in a following way: Let $x \in \bigcup_{i \in I}S_i$ then $x \in S_i$ for some $i \in I$. Then for point $x$ we define coordinates $x = \sum_{x_i \in X}a_ix_i$ for which $a_i>0$ only for finitely many $i \in I$ and $\sum_{i \in I}a_i = 1$ holds.

\end{maar}

It is easy to see that coordinates are well defined. If $x$ belongs to two different simplex $S$ and $S'$ then $x$ belongs to finite simplicial complex spanned by generators of $S \cup S'$. Thus the statement reduces to finite dimensional case. Because face of any simplex in the collection belongs to collection we see that simplicial complex spanned by generators $S \cup S'$ is union of some faces of simplex which we get by taking vertices to be $S \cup S'$ and thus $x$ has well defined coordinates. 

\begin{maar}
Let $(I,\lambda)$ be inverse system and $\phi: \lambda' \rightarrow \lambda$ some functor. Let $(I \phi, \lambda' )$ be inverse system described above. Then we say $\phi$ is limit preserving functor, if it satisfies $\phi(I^{-1}(\lim I)) = I^{-1}(\lim(I \phi) )$ \footnote{Because we defined $\phi$ to be functor between $\lambda$ and $\lambda'$ we have to use functo $I^{-1}$, which is well-defined because of bijectivity of functor $I$. }

\begin{lem}
Let $\beta$ and $\alpha$ be coverings of $(X,A)$ in such way that $\alpha \leq \beta$ and let $p$ be a projection map belonging to $\mathcal{P}(\alpha,\beta)$. Let the map $p'^\beta_\alpha:\mathcal{S}(X,A)_\beta \rightarrow \mathcal{S}(X,A)_\alpha$ be a map between simplices defined by edges $U \in \mathcal{S}(X,A)_\beta$ with the requirement of being piecewise linear on the other elements. Then the map $p'^{\beta}_{\alpha}$ is well-defined.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Let $x$ be an arbitrary element of $\mathcal{S}(X,A)_\beta$, then it belongs to some simplex. Let $S$ be the simplex which is intersection of all simplices in $\mathcal{S}(X,A)_\beta$ which have property that intersection with $\{x\}$ is non-empty. In the simplex $S$ point $x$ has a unique representation $x = \sum_{i \in J}r_ia_i$ where the elements $a_i$ are edges and $r_i$ non-negative real numbers such that $\sum_{i \in J}r_i = 1$ holds. By definition of map $p'$ this point is mapped to $p'(x) = \sum_{i \in J}r_ip^\beta_\alpha(a_i) $ which is uniquely determined. Thus the map $p'$ is well-defined.
\end{proof}

We will now prove that the map $p$ is simplicial.

\begin{lem}
	Projection maps $p^\beta_\alpha$ are simplicial.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $s$ be a simplex in $\mathcal{S}(X,A)_\beta$ spanned by some sets $\{U_i\}_{i \in J}$ such that $\bigcap_{i \in J}U_i \neq \emptyset $. Every $U_i$ is mapped to some vertex $U_i'$ in $\mathcal{S}(X,A)_\alpha$ for which $U_i \subset U_i'$. Intersection $\bigcap_{i \in J}U'_i$ is clearly non empty, so every simplex is mapped inside some simplex.
\end{proof}

Let $x$ be an arbitrary element of $\mathcal{S}(X,A)_\beta$, then it belongs to some simplex. Let $S$ be the simplex which is intersection of all simplices in $\mathcal{S}(X,A)_\beta$ which have property that intersection with $\{x\}$ is non-empty. In the simplex $S$ point $x$ has a unique representation $x = \sum_{i \in J}r_ia_i$ where the elements $a_i$ are edges and $r_i$ non-negative real numbers such that $\sum_{i \in J}r_i = 1$ holds. By definition of map $p'$ this point is mapped to $p'(x) = \sum_{i \in J}r_ip^\beta_\alpha(a_i) $ which is uniquely determined. Thus the map $p'$ is well-defined.


\begin{maar}
Respectively we say that the relation corresponds contra-variantly, if  

$$\hom(a,b) = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\{\lambda^b_a(j)\}_{j \in J(a,b)}  & \mbox{if } a \leq b \\
\emptyset & \mbox{else.} 
\end{array}
\right.  $$ 

The composition rule is defined for all morphisms $\lambda^c_b(i) \circ \lambda^b_a(j) = \lambda^c_a(k)$ and the identity morphism $\lambda^a_a$ is found for every $a$.
\end{maar}

\begin{lem}\label{formingsystem}
	A quasi-ordered class of objects together with corresponding class of morphisms forms a category.  
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	We denote the object and morphism classes as defined above and prove that those collections satisfies the needed requirements to be called a category
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*),ref=(\arabic*)]
		\item The associativity property: $(\lambda_c^d \circ \lambda^c_b) \circ \lambda^b_a = \lambda^d_a = \lambda_c^d \circ (\lambda^c_b \circ \lambda^b_a)$
		\item $\lambda^{a}_a \circ \lambda^b_a = \lambda^b_a $ and  $\lambda^{b}_a \circ \lambda^b_b = \lambda^b_a $ clearly holds
		
	\end{enumerate}
	The proof for the contra-variant is similar and we leave it to the reader to fill in the details.
\end{proof}

and following two properties are satisfied. For any two morphisms $\lambda^b_a(i)$, $\lambda^c_b(j)$ there exists some morphism $ \lambda^c_a(k)$ for which $ \lambda^b_a(i) \circ \lambda^c_b(j) = \lambda^c_a(k)$ holds and there exists identity morphism $\lambda^a_a$ for every $a$.

\begin{proof}
%%Using \ref{} goothe category $COV(X,A)$ with the quasi-order relation forms a covariant index categ
First we have to show that $I_{\alpha}^{\alpha}$ is identity function for every $\alpha \in$ COV$(X,A)$. We already know that identity map between simplicial complexes is projection map and because identity map induces identity map between the complexes by uniqueness of $I_{\alpha}^{\alpha}$ we see that the map has to be identity map between corresponding homology groups.\newline Now for every coverings $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ of pair $(X,A)$ for which relation $\alpha \leq \beta \leq \gamma$ holds we have to show that $I_{\beta}^{\gamma} \circ I_{\alpha}^{\beta} = I^{\gamma}_{\alpha}$. By lemma \ref{compofprojmaps} the composition of corresponding projection maps $p_{\beta}^{\gamma} \circ p_{\alpha}^{\beta}$ is projection map. Thus it defines map $I^{\gamma}_{\alpha}$.
\end{proof}

and maps $f_{\beta}$ and $p^\beta_\alpha$, every edge $a_{J(i)}$ is mapped to some element $p^\beta_\alpha f_{\beta}(a_{J(i)})$. By the definition of covering $\alpha'$ there exists an element $f_{\alpha}^{-1} (p^\beta_\alpha f_{\beta}(a_{J(i)}))$ in its collection.

\begin{proof}
Let $\{a_{J(1)}, ... , a_{J(n)}\}$ be some simplex in $\mathcal{S}(X,A)_{\beta'}$. For every edge $U$ the set $f^{-1} \circ p \circ f(U) $ is non-empty because $p$ maps $f(U)$ to a larger set. Thus for every edge $U_i$ there is a corresponding edge in $\mathcal{S}(X,A)_{\alpha'}$. We can now define a map $p^{\beta'}_{\alpha'}: \mathcal{S}(X,A)_{\beta'} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}(X,A)_{\alpha}$ in such way that the edge $U$ is mapped to the edge $f^{-1}pfU $ and we extend this map by linearity. Now, by defining the map $p^{\beta'}_{\alpha'}$ in such way for every simplex, we get a well-defined map that makes the diagram commute.

\section{Well-definedness of the \v{C}ech homology groups}
In this section we will provide a condition which will guarantee that the \v{C}ech homology groups are well-defined. 
...
From now on in this chapter we assume that the topological spaces are such for which the \v{C}ech groups  are well-defined. 

Let $(X,A)$ be topological pair and $\alpha = \mathcal{C}(V_x, J, J')$ be its covering. Suppose that for every $V_x$ there exists a regular covering $\beta(x) = \mathcal{C}(U^x_i, H_x, H_x')$ of an unit interval $[0,1]$. Let $$H = \bigcup_{x \in J} H_x \text{ and }H'= \bigcup_{x \in J} H'_x.$$ Let $f:H \rightarrow J$ be a function which tells in which set of the union does some specific element $H_x$ belong to. Covering $\gamma$ of the pair $(X \times [0,1], A \times [0,1]) $ defined in the following way:
$$\gamma = \mathcal{C}(V_{f(i)} \times U^{f(i)}_i, H, H')  $$
is called a stacked covering over $\alpha$.

\begin{maar}
Let $(X,A)$ and $(Y,B)$ be pairs of geometric complexes and let $f$ be a continuous function between pairs. Then we say that the map $f$ is simplicial if for any simplex in $X$ the images of vertexes of the simplex span some simplex in $Y$ and the images of vertexes of a simplex in $A$ span some simplex in $B$.
\end{maar}

Let $C_{*}$ be a chain complex of topological space $X$ with coefficients $G$. Then we define homomorphism $\text{Ind}_{(X,G)}$ to be special case of homomorphism $\text{In}_M$, where we choose $M$ to be the 0th element of the chain complex $C_0(X;G)$.

\begin{lause}
\textbf{Excision axiom} for \v{C}ech homology with compact carriers 
\end{lause}
\begin{proof}


	 Let $(X,A)$ be a topological pair and let $U$ be subset of $X$, for which conditions of excision are satisfied. 	Let $(C,C')$ be arbitrary pair for which $C \subset X$ and $C' \subset A$ . From \v{C}ech homology theory, we know that 
		$$\check{H}_n(i):\check{H}_n(C \setminus U,C' \setminus U) \rightarrow \check{H}_n(X,A)$$
	is an isomorphism. Thus there exists an inverse to this $p_{(X,A)}$.

\begin{lem}\label{inversemorphismexistence}
Let  $(I,\lambda)$ and $(I',\lambda')$ be inverse systems for which limit exists. Let $\{f_a\}$ be inverse system of morphisms corresponding to that pair. Then there exists a unique morphism $\lim f:\lim I \rightarrow \lim I'$ for which the condition $\lim f \circ u_{I, \phi(a)} = u_{I',a} \circ f_a$ holds for every $a \in \lambda'$ .
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
\textbf{Existence:} Consider the following diagram
\begin{diagram}\label{morphismbetweenlimits}

	\draw[->] (x2) -- (y2);
	\draw[->] (w2) -- (d2);
	\draw[->] (d2) -- (x2);
	\draw[->] (d2) -- (y2);
	
	\draw[->] (w) |- (w2);

	\draw[->] (y) -| (y2);
	
	
	\draw[dashed][->](d) -- (d2);
	
	
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{diagram}

To prove that the limit morphism exists we form the following triangle out of the diagram described above:

$$
\begin{tikzpicture}

\node (w) at (2,0) {\(\lim I\)};

\node (x2) at (0.5,-0.7) {\(f_a \rho_{\phi(a)}\)};

\node (x) at (0,-2) {\(I'(a)\)};

\node (y2) at (3.5,-0.7) {\(f_b \rho_{\phi(b)}\)};

\node (y) at (4,-2) {\(I'(b)\)};

\node (f) at (2,-2.4){\(I'^{a}_{b}\)};

\node (d) at (2,-1){\(\lim I'\)};

\node (phid) at (1.4,-1.6){\(\rho'_a\)};
\node (phid2) at (2.6,-1.6){\(\rho'_b\)};


\draw[->] (w) -- (y);
\draw[->] (w) -- (x);
\draw[->] (x) -- (y);
\draw[dashed][->] (w) -- (d);
\draw[->] (d) -- (x);
\draw[->] (d) -- (y);


\end{tikzpicture}
$$
Then by definition of limit there exists a unique morphism $\lim f:\lim I \rightarrow \lim I'$ for which the diagram commutes. We will prove now that the universal property $\lim f \circ u_{I, \phi(a)} = u_{I',a} \circ f_a$ holds for this morphism. By diagram \ref{morphismbetweenlimits} and the fact that the family of functions $\{f_a\}$ is a natural transformation, the following diagram commutes:
$$
\begin{tikzpicture}

\node (w) at (2,0) {\(I(\phi(n))\)};

\node (x2) at (0.5,-0.7) {\(f_a \omega_{\phi(a)}\)};

\node (x) at (0,-2) {\(I'(a)\)};

\node (y2) at (3.5,-0.7) {\(f_b \omega_{\phi(b)}\)};

\node (y) at (4,-2) {\(I'(b)\)};

\node (f) at (2,-2.4){\(I'^{a}_{b}\)};

\node (d) at (2,-1){\(\lim I'\)};

\node (phid) at (1.4,-1.6){\(\rho'_a\)};
\node (phid2) at (2.6,-1.6){\(\rho'_b\)};


\draw[->] (w) -- (y);
\draw[->] (w) -- (x);
\draw[->] (x) -- (y);
\draw[dashed][->] (w) -- (d);
\draw[->] (d) -- (x);
\draw[->] (d) -- (y);


\end{tikzpicture}
$$
Both maps $\lim f \circ u_{I, \phi(a)}$ and $u_{I',a} \circ f_a$ complete the diagram. Thus by uniqueness of the map corresponding to limit, we can conclude that the functions are same. \newline
\textbf{Uniqueness:} Assume that there exists another morphism $g: \lim I \rightarrow \lim I'$, for which $g \circ u_{I, \phi(a)} = u_{I',a} \circ f_a$ for all $a \in \lambda'$. 
\end{proof}

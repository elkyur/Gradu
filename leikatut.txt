A functor $L:J' \rightarrow J $ is cofinal if for every element $k \in J$ there exists $j' \in J'$ and morphism $Lj' \rightarrow k$.

Let $C$ be a category which is indexed by a category $J$ and let $F$ be the indexing functor. Let $f:X \rightarrow Y$ be an arbitrary morphism in the category $J$ and let $D$ be an object of the category $C$ which forms a cone together with a family of morphisms $\{\phi_X\}_{X \in \ob(C)}$ and morphism $f$. We say that $(D, \phi)$ is a limit of $C$ if the following property holds: If $N$ together with family $\{\omega_X\}_{X \in \ob(C)} $ and morphism $f$ is any other cone of category $C$, then there exists a unique morphism $u:N \rightarrow D$ in such way that the following diagram commutes:
\end{maar} 

In this section we will interpret category as a model of first order logic

The colimit of a category $C$ is the dual statement of limit of $C$. We define the cocone to be dual of cone. Let $J$ be index category of $C$ then we say that a cocone induced by $D$ is the colimit of category $C$ if for every other cocone induced by $N$ there exists a unique morphism $u:D \rightarrow N$ in such a way that the diagram below commutes:

Let $\lambda$ be a quasi-ordered set and $\mathcal{L}$ a category. A direct $\lambda$-system consist of functor $D$ which assigns unique object $D(\lambda) \in \mathcal{L}$ and a family of morphism in such way that for every pair $a \leq b$ there exists unique morphism $D^b_a: D(a) \rightarrow D(b)$. The family of morphisms satisfies following conditions:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*),ref=(\arabic*)]
	
	\item For every triple $a \leq b \leq c$ in $\lambda$ functions commute in a following way: $D^c_b \circ D^b_a = D^c_a$
	\item For every $a \in \lambda$: $D^a_a = id_a$
	
\end{enumerate}

\end{maar}

The structure in above definition can be also viewed as category $C$ in such way that $\ob(C) = D(\lambda)$ and for every $D(a),D(b) \in \ob(C)$ there exists exactly one morphism in $\hom(D(a),D(b)$. In other words $\lambda$ is indexation of subcategory of $\mathcal{L}$.

Next we introduce a bit more complex category 

\begin{maar}
Direct systems together with natural transformations between them form Category. We will denote elements of this category shortly $(\lambda, \mathcal{L})$
\end{maar}
Taking dual and using functor $I$ instead of $D$ we see that natural transformation with inverse system form category. We will denote this category by $(\lambda, \mathcal{L}^{op})$. Now we can define limit of the category $(\lambda, \mathcal{L})$. We see that for every quasi-order $\lambda$ and object $k$ in $\mathcal{L}^{op}$ we can define inverse system by mapping every element $\lambda$ to the object $k$ and every functor between objects in $\lambda$ to identity functor. This forms inverse system which we will denote by $K$. Now natural transformations $\phi_a : D(a) \rightarrow K$ between $K$ and arbitrary element in $(\lambda, \mathcal{L})$ induces following: co(cone) 
$$
\begin{tikzpicture}

\node (w) at (2,0) {\(K\)};

\node (x2) at (0.7,-0.7) {\(\phi_a\)};

\node (x) at (0,-2) {\(D(a)\)};

\node (y2) at (3.3,-0.7) {\(\phi_b\)};

\node (y) at (4,-2) {\(D(b)\)};

\node (f) at (2,-2.4){\(D^b_a\)};


\draw[->] (y) -- (w);
\draw[->] (x) -- (w);
\draw[->] (x) -- (y);


\end{tikzpicture}
$$
So we can define (co)limit of this structure in unique way if it exists.

\begin{maar}
Let $X$ be set of vertices. Then abstract simplicial complex consist of collection $\{S_i\}_{i \in I}$ of finite dimensional simplexes which have edges in set $X$. The collection has property which is for every simplex face of it belongs to the collection. For every point in abstract simplicial complex $\mathcal{S}(X)$ we define coordinates in a following way: Let $x \in \bigcup_{i \in I}S_i$ then $x \in S_i$ for some $i \in I$. Then for point $x$ we define coordinates $x = \sum_{x_i \in X}a_ix_i$ for which $a_i>0$ only for finitely many $i \in I$ and $\sum_{i \in I}a_i = 1$ holds.

\end{maar}

It is easy to see that coordinates are well defined. If $x$ belongs to two different simplex $S$ and $S'$ then $x$ belongs to finite simplicial complex spanned by generators of $S \cup S'$. Thus the statement reduces to finite dimensional case. Because face of any simplex in the collection belongs to collection we see that simplicial complex spanned by generators $S \cup S'$ is union of some faces of simplex which we get by taking vertices to be $S \cup S'$ and thus $x$ has well defined coordinates. 

\begin{maar}
Let $(I,\lambda)$ be inverse system and $\phi: \lambda' \rightarrow \lambda$ some functor. Let $(I \phi, \lambda' )$ be inverse system described above. Then we say $\phi$ is limit preserving functor, if it satisfies $\phi(I^{-1}(\lim I)) = I^{-1}(\lim(I \phi) )$ \footnote{Because we defined $\phi$ to be functor between $\lambda$ and $\lambda'$ we have to use functo $I^{-1}$, which is well-defined because of bijectivity of functor $I$. }
